# Pens-Holder-Design


## This project involves the design of a pens holder using onshape.
## The pen holder is designed to accommodate various writing instruments and keep them organized at the disk tabel 


## Tools used using onshape:
1-Sketch: To create the rectangular outline and the circular shape for the holders.

2-Extrude: To give the base and the holders thickness and height.

3-Shell:To create hollow sections within the base and holders, setting the desired wall thickness

4- Fillet: Applied to the edges of the base and holders to create smoother transitions.
